##Trackpal

Have you ever thought of an app to track where your friends are when you planned for a meeting and most of them turn up late because of lame excuses. Trackpal is your solution.
With Trackpal you can track all the people within the group about their journey to the destination based on the geolocation of the browser.


###Current features:
The following are the things that the user can do with the application currently:
1. User can register to the application.
2. He can add friends.
3. He can select from the friends to join for a meetup at certain location at certain date and time.
4. After he selects the friends and creates a new meetup group, the message is broadcasted to all his friends within the group.
5. Once any member within the group comes within 1 mile of the destination a message is sent to all the other people in the group.

###Nice to have:
The following are the nice to have features that will be implemented shortly:
1. Small chart displaying the speed at which the users are travelling.
2. Text messages on the map.
3. Image inclusions in the marker.

###Known Bugs
The following are the open issues with the application:
1. Heroku does not show the leaflet map and crashes at times.
2. Only one user marker displays the name of the user currently.

4. Life of the map should be until the time of the meetup and user should be redirected to the show page.
